/*
 * Remote PCI host device
 *
 * Unlike PCI host devices that model physical hardware, the purpose
 * of this PCI host is to host multi-process QEMU devices.
 *
 * Multi-process QEMU extends the PCI host of a QEMU machine into a
 * remote process. Any PCI device attached to the remote process is
 * visible in the QEMU guest. This allows existing QEMU device models
 * to be reused in the remote process.
 *
 * This PCI host is purely a container for PCI devices. It's fake in the
 * sense that the guest never sees this PCI host and has no way of
 * accessing it. Its job is just to provide the environment that QEMU
 * PCI device models need when running in a remote process.
