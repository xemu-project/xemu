Berkeley SoftFloat is a software implementation of binary floating-point
that conforms to the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic.  SoftFloat
is distributed in the form of C source code.  Building the SoftFloat sources
generates a library file (typically `softfloat.a` or `libsoftfloat.a`)
containing the floating-point subroutines.


The SoftFloat package is documented in the following files in the `doc`
subdirectory:

* [SoftFloat.html](http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/SoftFloat-3/doc/SoftFloat.html) Documentation for using the SoftFloat functions.
* [SoftFloat-source.html](http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/SoftFloat-3/doc/SoftFloat-source.html) Documentation for building SoftFloat.
* [SoftFloat-history.html](http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/SoftFloat-3/doc/SoftFloat-history.html) History of the major changes to SoftFloat.

Other files in the package comprise the source code for SoftFloat.
