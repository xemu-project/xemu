This directory contains scripts for generating a build of QEMU that
closely matches the CentOS Stream[1] builds of the qemu-kvm package.

To have the environment ready to configure, build QEMU and run tests,
please start with a CentOS Stream machine and:

 * apply the generic "build-environment.yml" playbook located at
   scripts/ci/setup

 * apply the "build-environment.yml" in the directory following the
   CentOS Stream version (such as "8").

This currently only covers CentOS Stream 8 environments and
packages[2].
