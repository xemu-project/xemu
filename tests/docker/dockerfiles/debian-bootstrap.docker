# Create Debian Bootstrap Image
#
# This is intended to be pre-poluated by:
#  - a first stage debootstrap (see debian-bootstrap.pre)
#  - a native qemu-$arch that binfmt_misc will run
FROM scratch

# Add everything from the context into the container
ADD . /

# Patch all mounts as docker already has stuff set up
# (this is not needed for later debootstraps but is harmless atm)
RUN sed -i 's/in_target mount/echo not for docker in_target mount/g' /debootstrap/functions

# Run stage 2
RUN /debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage

# At this point we can install additional packages if we want
# Duplicate deb line as deb-src
RUN cat /etc/apt/sources.list | sed "s/deb/deb-src/" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
