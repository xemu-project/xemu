# Docker Debian Native
#
# This is intended to build QEMU on native host systems. Debian is
# chosen due to the broadest range on supported host systems for QEMU.
#
# This docker target is based on the docker.io Debian Bullseye base
# image rather than QEMU's base because we would otherwise confuse the
# build grabbing stuff from the registry built for other
# architectures.
