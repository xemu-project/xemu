# This is the set of runtime suppressions of TSan warnings.
# The goal would be to have here only items we do not
# plan to fix, and to explain why for each item.

# TSan reports a double lock on RECURSIVE mutexes.
# Since the recursive lock is intentional, we choose to ignore it.
mutex:pthread_mutex_lock

# TSan reports a race between pthread_mutex_init() and
# pthread_mutex_lock().  Since this is outside of QEMU,
# we choose to ignore it.
