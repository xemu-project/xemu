This is for small sample images to be used with qemu-iotests, intended for
non-native formats that QEMU supports for compatibility.  The idea is to use
the native tool to create the sample image.

For instance, a VHDX image in this directory would be an image created not by
QEMU itself, but rather created by Hyper-V.

Sample images added here must be compressed with bzip2.
