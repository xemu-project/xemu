== block_size must be a multiple of 512 ==
qemu-io: can't open device TEST_DIR/simple-pattern.cloop: block_size 513 must be a multiple of 512

== block_size cannot be zero ==
qemu-io: can't open device TEST_DIR/simple-pattern.cloop: block_size cannot be zero

== huge block_size ===
qemu-io: can't open device TEST_DIR/simple-pattern.cloop: block_size 4294966784 must be 64 MB or less

== offsets_size overflow ===
qemu-io: can't open device TEST_DIR/simple-pattern.cloop: n_blocks 4294967295 must be 536870911 or less

== refuse images that require too many offsets ===
qemu-io: can't open device TEST_DIR/simple-pattern.cloop: image requires too many offsets, try increasing block size

== refuse images with non-monotonically increasing offsets ==
qemu-io: can't open device TEST_DIR/simple-pattern.cloop: offsets not monotonically increasing at index 1, image file is corrupt

== refuse images with invalid compressed block size ==
qemu-io: can't open device TEST_DIR/simple-pattern.cloop: invalid compressed block size at index 1, image file is corrupt
*** done
