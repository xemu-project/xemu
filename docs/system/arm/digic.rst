Canon A1100 (``canon-a1100``)
=============================

This machine is a model of the Canon PowerShot A1100 camera, which
uses the DIGIC SoC. This model is based on reverse engineering efforts
by the contributors to the `CHDK <http://chdk.wikia.com/>`_ and
`Magic Lantern <http://www.magiclantern.fm/>`_ projects.

The emulation is incomplete. In particular it can't be used
to run the original camera firmware, but it can successfully run
an experimental version of the `barebox bootloader <http://www.barebox.org/>`_.
