/*
 * This module implements I/O limits using the leaky bucket
 * algorithm. The code is independent of the I/O units, but it is
 * currently used for bytes per second and operations per second.
 *
 * Three parameters can be set by the user:
 *
 * - avg: the desired I/O limits in units per second.
 * - max: the limit during bursts, also in units per second.
 * - burst_length: the maximum length of the burst period, in seconds.
 *
 * Here's how it works:
 *
 * - The bucket level (number of performed I/O units) is kept in
 *   bkt.level and leaks at a rate of bkt.avg units per second.
 *
 * - The size of the bucket is bkt.max * bkt.burst_length. Once the
 *   bucket is full no more I/O is performed until the bucket leaks
 *   again. This is what makes the I/O rate bkt.avg.
 *
 * - The bkt.avg rate does not apply until the bucket is full,
 *   allowing the user to do bursts until then. The I/O limit during
 *   bursts is bkt.max. To enforce this limit we keep an additional
 *   bucket in bkt.burst_level that leaks at a rate of bkt.max units
 *   per second.
 *
 * - Because of all of the above, the user can perform I/O at a
 *   maximum of bkt.max units per second for at most bkt.burst_length
 *   seconds in a row. After that the bucket will be full and the I/O
 *   rate will go down to bkt.avg.
 *
 * - Since the bucket always leaks at a rate of bkt.avg, this also
 *   determines how much the user needs to wait before being able to
 *   do bursts again.
