/*
 * The QAPI schema defines both a set of C data types, and a QMP wire
 * format.  QAPI objects can contain references to other QAPI objects,
 * resulting in a directed acyclic graph.  QAPI also generates visitor
 * functions to walk these graphs.  This file represents the interface
 * for doing work at each node of a QAPI graph; it can also be used
 * for a virtual walk, where there is no actual QAPI C struct.
 *
 * There are four kinds of visitors: input visitors (QObject, string,
 * and QemuOpts) parse an external representation and build the
 * corresponding QAPI object, output visitors (QObject and string)
 * take a QAPI object and generate an external representation, the
 * dealloc visitor takes a QAPI object (possibly partially
 * constructed) and recursively frees it, and the clone visitor
 * performs a deep clone of a QAPI object.
 *
 * While the dealloc and QObject input/output visitors are general,
 * the string, QemuOpts, and clone visitors have some implementation
 * limitations; see the documentation for each visitor for more
 * details on what it supports.  Also, see visitor-impl.h for the
 * callback contracts implemented by each visitor, and
 * docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.txt for more about the QAPI code
 * generator.
 *
 * All of the visitors are created via:
 *
 * Visitor *subtype_visitor_new(parameters...);
 *
 * A visitor should be used for exactly one top-level visit_type_FOO()
 * or virtual walk; if that is successful, the caller can optionally
 * call visit_complete() (useful only for output visits, but safe to
 * call on all visits).  Then, regardless of success or failure, the
 * user should call visit_free() to clean up resources.  It is okay to
 * free the visitor without completing the visit, if some other error
 * is detected in the meantime.
 *
 * The clone and dealloc visitor should not be used directly outside
 * of QAPI code.  Use the qapi_free_FOO() and QAPI_CLONE() instead,
 * described below.
 *
 * All QAPI types have a corresponding function with a signature
 * roughly compatible with this:
 *
 * bool visit_type_FOO(Visitor *v, const char *name, T obj, Error **errp);
 *
 * where T is FOO for scalar types, and FOO * otherwise.  The scalar
 * visitors are declared here; the remaining visitors are generated in
 * qapi-visit-MODULE.h.
 *
 * The @name parameter of visit_type_FOO() describes the relation
 * between this QAPI value and its parent container.  When visiting
 * the root of a tree, @name is ignored; when visiting a member of an
 * object, @name is the key associated with the value; when visiting a
 * member of a list, @name is NULL; and when visiting the member of an
 * alternate, @name should equal the name used for visiting the
 * alternate.
 *
 * The visit_type_FOO() functions take a non-null @obj argument; they
 * allocate *@obj during input visits, leave it unchanged during
 * output and clone visits, and free it (recursively) during a dealloc
 * visit.
 *
 * Each function also takes the customary @errp argument (see
 * qapi/error.h for details), for reporting any errors (such as if a
 * member @name is not present, or is present but not the specified
 * type).  Only input visitors can fail.
 *
 * If an error is detected during visit_type_FOO() with an input
 * visitor, then *@obj will be set to NULL for pointer types, and left
 * unchanged for scalar types.
 *
 * Using an output or clone visitor with an incomplete object has
 * undefined behavior (other than a special case for visit_type_str()
 * treating NULL like ""), while the dealloc visitor safely handles
 * incomplete objects.  Since input visitors never produce an
 * incomplete object, such an object is possible only by manual
 * construction.
 *
 * visit_type_FOO() returns true on success, false on error.
 *
 * For the QAPI object types (structs, unions, and alternates), there
 * is an additional generated function in qapi-visit-MODULE.h
 * compatible with:
 *
 * bool visit_type_FOO_members(Visitor *v, FOO *obj, Error **errp);
 *
 * for visiting the members of a type without also allocating the QAPI
 * struct.  It also returns true on success, false on error.
 *
 * Additionally, QAPI pointer types (structs, unions, alternates, and
 * lists) have a generated function in qapi-types-MODULE.h compatible
 * with:
 *
 * void qapi_free_FOO(FOO *obj);
 *
 * Does nothing when @obj is NULL.
 *
 * Such objects may also be used with macro
 *
 * Type *QAPI_CLONE(Type, src);
 *
 * in order to perform a deep clone of @src.
 *
 * For QAPI types can that inherit from a base type, a function is
 * generated for going from the derived type to the base type:
 *
 * BASE *qapi_CHILD_base(CHILD *obj);
 *
 * Typical input visitor usage involves:
 *
 * <example>
 *  Foo *f;
 *  Error *err = NULL;
 *  Visitor *v;
 *
 *  v = FOO_visitor_new(...);
 *  if (!visit_type_Foo(v, NULL, &f, &err)) {
 *      ...handle error...
 *  } else {
 *      ...use f...
 *  }
 *  visit_free(v);
 *  qapi_free_Foo(f);
 * </example>
 *
 * For a list, it is:
 * <example>
 *  FooList *l;
 *  Error *err = NULL;
 *  Visitor *v;
 *
 *  v = FOO_visitor_new(...);
 *  if (!visit_type_FooList(v, NULL, &l, &err)) {
 *      ...handle error...
 *  } else {
 *      for ( ; l; l = l->next) {
 *          ...use l->value...
 *      }
 *  }
 *  visit_free(v);
 *  qapi_free_FooList(l);
 * </example>
 *
 * Typical output visitor usage:
 *
 * <example>
 *  Foo *f = ...obtain populated object...
 *  Visitor *v;
 *  Type *result;
 *
 *  v = FOO_visitor_new(..., &result);
 *  visit_type_Foo(v, NULL, &f, &error_abort);
 *  visit_complete(v, &result);
 *  visit_free(v);
 *  ...use result...
 * </example>
 *
 * It is also possible to use the visitors to do a virtual walk, where
 * no actual QAPI object is present.  In this situation, decisions
 * about what needs to be walked are made by the calling code, and
 * structured visits are split between pairs of start and end methods
 * (where the end method must be called if the start function
 * succeeded, even if an intermediate visit encounters an error).
 * Thus, a virtual walk corresponding to '{ "list": [1, 2] }' looks
 * like:
 *
 * <example>
 *  Visitor *v;
 *  Error *err = NULL;
 *  bool ok = false;
 *  int value;
 *
 *  v = FOO_visitor_new(...);
 *  if (!visit_start_struct(v, NULL, NULL, 0, &err)) {
 *      goto out;
 *  }
 *  if (!visit_start_list(v, "list", NULL, 0, &err)) {
 *      goto outobj;
 *  }
 *  value = 1;
 *  if (!visit_type_int(v, NULL, &value, &err)) {
 *      goto outlist;
 *  }
 *  value = 2;
 *  if (!visit_type_int(v, NULL, &value, &err)) {
 *      goto outlist;
 *  }
 *  ok = true;
 * outlist:
 *  if (ok) {
 *      ok = visit_check_list(v, &err);
 *  }
 *  visit_end_list(v, NULL);
 *  if (ok) {
 *      ok = visit_check_struct(v, &err);
 *  }
 * outobj:
 *  visit_end_struct(v, NULL);
 * out:
 *  visit_free(v);
 * </example>
 *
 * This file provides helpers for use by the generated
 * visit_type_FOO(): visit_optional() for the 'has_member' field
 * associated with optional 'member' in the C struct,
 * visit_next_list() for advancing through a FooList linked list, and
 * visit_is_input() for cleaning up on failure.
