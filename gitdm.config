# This is the gitdm configuration file for QEMU.
#
# It is to be used with LWN's git dataminer tool for generating
# reports about development activity in the QEMU repo. The LWN gitdm
# tool can be found at:
#
#   git://git.lwn.net/gitdm.git
#
# A run to generate a report for the last year of activity would be
#
#   git log --numstat --since "Last Year" | gitdm -n -l 10

# EmailAliases lets us cope with developers who use more
# than one address or have changed addresses. This duplicates some of
# the information in the existing .mailmap but in a slightly different
# form.

# EmailMap does the main work of mapping addresses onto
# employers.

#
# Use GroupMap to map a file full of addresses to the
# same employer. This is used for people that don't post from easily
# identifiable corporate emails. Please keep this list sorted.
